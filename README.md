# Google-Trends

This repository contains python code used to collect daily Google Trends data on a specific keyword between 2018 and 2021. Since daily Google Trends data is not available for time periods longer than 9 months, I had to rescale the daily data using the weekly data in order to make the different years comparable. I use the rescaling method outlined in Brodeur et al. (2021) to achieve this goal.
